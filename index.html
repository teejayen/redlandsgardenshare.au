    The Redlands Garden Share has been established as a community and resource swap initiative, aimed at fostering self-reliance, sustainability, and community building. By sharing resources such as homegrown produce, seeds, edible plants, and more, we can reduce our waste, decrease dependence on supermarkets and decrease food miles, while also learning new skills and knowledge from your neighbours.
    <br>
    <br>
    Join us on the first Saturday of the month between 0730-0930 at the Bayview Conservation Area (487-503 German Church Rd, Redland Bay QLD 4165).
